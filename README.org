* Shapley Flow

  This repository contains implementation for the AISTATS 2021 paper 
  "[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14592.pdf][Shapley Flow: A Graph-based Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions]]".
  
  The directory is organized as the following. 

  ~notebooks/~ contains case studies and experiments for the paper 
  
  - [[./notebooks/tutorial.ipynb][Tutorial for Shapley Flow]]
  - [[./notebooks/synthetic_sanity_checks.ipynb][Sanity check examples for Section 4.3]]
  - [[./notebooks/linear_nutrition.ipynb][Experiments with the nutrition dataset for sanity check with linear model in Section 4.3]]
